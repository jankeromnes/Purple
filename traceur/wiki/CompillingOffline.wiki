#summary How to use the traceurc to compile to Javascript from the command line.

Traceur includes a shell script `traceurc` to let you compile Javascript code with Traceur extensions down to vanilla Javascript. You can then use this Javascript directly without needing to include the compiler.

== Compiling Files ==

First, make sure you have [http://nodejs.org Node] installed. Then create a Javascript file with some Traceur extensions in it. For example:

{{{
// greeter.js
class Greeter {
  sayHi() { console.log('Hi!'); }
}

var greeter = new Greeter();
greeter.sayHi();
}}}

Invoke the compiler like so:

{{{
  $ ./traceurc greeter.js
}}}

This will create an `out/` directory containing `greeter.js` which has all Traceur extensions desugared to plain Javascript.

== Using Compiled Files ==

The code generated by Traceur depends on a small runtime library containing Javascript code for things like creating classes, handling spread arguments, etc. To use code compiled from Traceur, you'll need to include that too. It lives at `src/runtime.js`.

So, we can test the `greeter.js` we just compiled with a minimal HTML page like:

{{{
<html> 
  <head> 
    <script src="src/runtime.js" type="text/javascript"></script> 
    <script src="out/greeter.js" type="text/javascript"></script> 
  </head> 
  <body> 
  </body> 
</html>
}}}

Load that in a browser and you should see "Hi!" in your console.
